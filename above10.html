    <h2>Visit museums</h2>
<div class="museum">
    <p>Museums are a really nice place to go to. Nowadays you have digital museums, with lights and 4d works. These kind of museums you can most of the time find in Amsterdam! One of them is Nyx and you have a lot more of them. If you don't like that, we also have normal museums with art you can see in real life. If you are a student you can take a look for a discount! </p>
